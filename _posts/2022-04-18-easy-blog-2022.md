summary: A quick setup and infrastructure for a blog in 2022

## Introduction

So this might be more of a meta post as this will be how easy it is to setup a blog now-a-days. This is also semi-hypocritical as this blog (you are reading) and I have written occasionally in for the last 4 years uses a Jekyll based blog engine and github pages. That means every post required a git commit and a push to the github pages. That is fine for me, being the tech guy I am, but for the less technical people, it is a bit annoying, and has a high barrier of entry. So this weekend I decided to set up a blog page for me and my friends to mess around on. I used Wordpress and Digital Ocean and MAN WAS IT EASY. I will give some quick set up tips. There are plenty of youtube videos out there so go DYOR (do your own research) if you want.

## Step 1- Get a domain
C'mon it is 2022, do you really not own a domain? I mean, you can't really own a domain, but you can get one. They cost somewhere between $10-20 per year to register that domain to you. I am not 100% certain what that meaning. I think it has something to with the IP address being represented in the readable domain. But it doesn't matter, pay the fee, get the name. I used [google domains](https://domains.google) and it is fairly straight forward. Just choose one you like. The actual domain I got for this blog was initially a joke domain to aggravate a friend.

## Step 2- Digital Ocean hosting
[![DigitalOcean Referral Badge](https://web-platforms.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%201.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=06fc594b9ad7&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)
Get a [digital account](https://m.do.co/c/06fc594b9ad7). If click that image you use the  code you will get $100 off the 60 day use. (full disclosure I will also get $25). You will use this to set up a $5/month droplet. This seems to be a happy medium for cost and ease of use. You need to use that $100 in the first 2 months so you can mess around with some other settings, but for most of you, the basic $5 droplet will be enough.

From there droplet creation you can actual choose a one click Wordpress setup (this is actually an Ubuntu - Linux image with Wordpress already set to deploy), which is amazing- it even lets you set up SSL when you deploy. I think GoDaddy charges like 70$/year for that. I had to do a bit of tweaking on my site because the SSL did not work right of the bat, but the best thing is if during set up you break something. It is so easy to just scrap the droplet and start over.

## Step 3- Wordpress
I am late to the game on Wordpress. It is like the defacto blog infrastructure for the web.[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org). I just didn't mess around with it until now and it is so simple to style and customize the pages. The are plenty of plugins as well to do whatever you want. I am using a crypto tracking one and set up right out of the box, without any code. Another nice thing is setting up multiple users. I can tell you from this (timtruty.com) blog that content creation is not always the easiest (*cough* this post *cough*).

## Step 4- Conclusion
Setting up a blog and styling and making users took me a total of probably 2 hours. Go check if out if you want, or hell, just go make your own- the internet does not have enough content.
