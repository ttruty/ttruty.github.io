#  Chicago Handshake Challenge game
## Rapid design and creation of Unity3D game
> This is a game I made to commemorate the Chicago Handshake Challenge that took place in 2016. There were 5 bars in the passport and you needed to get a stamp from each one after drinking a "Chicago Handshake" - This is one tall boy of old style beer and a shot of Malort. If you are unfamiliar with Malort, the nectar of the gods; it is a choice liquor of hipsters in the Chicago-land region. Try one if you are able. I do not know why this is a thing in Chicago, but it is. Sometimes when I really miss Chicago I can still taste the Malort after taste in my gut...

The base game came out of a class from [gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/complete-c-unity-game-developer-3d-online-course-2020/). This site has some great content for getting started or brushing up on your Unity skills.

 - The game itself is a rocket, lunar lander type game.
 - The goal is to get the Malort bottle to the Old Style can
 - The controls system is 2D, but the level design is 3D. Making for some interesting game play.
 - Sounds are from [Chicago L . org](https://www.chicago-l.org/multimedia/sounds/). This is a cool site to find the CTA sound you need.
 - The other images and graphics were grabbed off google.
 - One game mechanic I am pretty proud of is the death animation where the Malort bottle with fly towards the screen.
 - An ambitions goal is a cease and desist letter from Jepson himself!

Game play:  "Space" is main thruster. "A" and "D" to thrust left and right. CHEERS!
